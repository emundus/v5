Looks up artist, and puts the artist name in the events title, and the artist bio and puts it in the forms 'events___description' field.  

To map a single 'from' to multiple 'to' elements, use an array from the 'to' value, like ['table___field1','table___field2']

Join records are now mapped with the full name(previously you had to append the full element name wth 'join__X___', and whilst this will still work it is no longer necessary
